# Windows 11 dark Bloom wallpaper (ultrawide)

This project features a high-quality recreation of the 4K Bloom wallpaper. The
original background gradient has been removed, and the image has been enhanced
to eliminate banding issues. The source file was meticulously crafted using
GIMP 3.0. The final desktop background image is provided in PNG format, ensuring
no loss of quality due to compression.
